goals

- define local-only packages; package names do not have to appear in nixpkgs
  For example 'cmake-examples-ex1' is a local package

- use nix flakes for version pinning.

- avoid allowing build instructions in flake.nix.
  Motivation:
  - flakes do not support cross-compilation (see Jade Lovelace's blog)
  - flakes do not support parameterization.

- define packages "the nixpkgs way" so that they can be trivially incorporated into nixpkgs,
  should we so desire.
